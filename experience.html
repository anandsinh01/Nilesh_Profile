                <h2>AI Technology Leader & Software Architect</h2>
                <p class="company">Identity and Transaction Management System</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In my role as a technology leader, I spearheaded the integration of Generative and Reactive OpenAI APIs into our Transaction and Identity Management System.
                        This initiative aimed to optimize our data pipeline, enabling faster identification and processing of secure financial transactions.
                        By reducing manual monitoring processes and enhancing data security, our application facilitates seamless data and transaction management across various
                        applications.Our implementation of AI-driven insights has not only expedited secure financial processes but has also had a
                        positive impact on our client's revenue and financial performance. This advancement allows our customers to benefit from improved efficiency and security
                        in financial transactions, ultimately enhancing their overall experience and satisfaction.
                        The implementation led to system availability increased by 95% and performance improved fivefold and downtime decreased, which enabled B2B
                        clients to more effectively attain their business goals.

                <h2>Solution Architect</h2>
                <p class="company">Physician Compensation and Honey Badger </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I designed and developed a scalable platform utilizing .NET Core, Syncfusion Charts, and OpenAI algorithms for Physician Compensation
                        and Honey Badger solution. This custom application offers intelligent compensation management solutions tailored for health systems,
                        medical groups, and physician groups to streamline the development, management, and evaluation of physician compensation plans.
                        By automating the calculation, adjudication, and monitoring of regulatory compliance, the application minimizes manual administrative tasks
                        and provides real-time feedback on physicians' performance under the compensation methodology.
                        Additionally, this application efficiently manages health care client data, enables hospitals to compare expenses on medical services and
                        medications, and allows clients to access reports, make payments, and submit complaints securely. It offers detailed charts for clients to
                        compare Financial Impact across different hospitals, Surgical Comorbidity Rates, Medical Comorbidity Rates, and more. The application
                        is seamlessly integrated with various Vendor systems to gather data for clients, resulting in improved data flow, enhanced product insights,
                        increased customer satisfaction, and strengthened brand reputation within healthcare financial workflows. The integration has significantly
                        enhanced system decision performance, security, and reliability, which resulted in a 3% net gain of $2.5 million.

                    <li>
                        I led the development and implementation of a scalable solution that transformed our customer financial management.
                        My responsibilities included automating tasks and overseeing follow-up procedures to enhance financial operations, secure financial
                        transactions, and empower representatives to focus on meaningful customer interactions. Through my initiatives, I enhanced financial
                        management efficiency by facilitating loan provisions and managing the automatic repayment of EMIs. These efforts resulted in a 22%
                        growth in annual vehicle sales, a 20% productivity increase, and savings of over $1.5 million in resource management expenses.
                        The system, utilized by over 2000 resources globally,
                        substantially elevated operational efficiency and revenue impact.

                    <li>
                        I spearheaded the development of an AML platform that analyzed the financial needs of customers worldwide to 
                        safeguard our business against AML risks. By integrating Azure services, serverless functions, and architecting
                        a cloud deployment strategy, I automated the enforcement of Anti-Money Laundering regulations. My responsibilities
                        included designing the platform for seamless integration with various systems, reducing manual data analysis, 
                        improving call quality assessment, and establishing a robust automated fraud detection and prevention system. 
                        Additionally, I conceptualized and implemented an AML-dependent epay-express pay platform to offer a hassle-free
                        financial transaction system to our firm's customers. This innovation not only saved 900 resources ($0.5 million/year)
                        but also increased the firm's financial growth by 10%. Furthermore, it enhanced customer satisfaction through secure data flow,
                        simplified AML regulations for customers, and it improved customer engagement and their benefits.
